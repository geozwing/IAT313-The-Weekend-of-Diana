        Diana takes it as a sign to turn around and go back home. Perhaps, it was too late anyway. As she was walking back, she heard someone yell “hey”. She chooses to ignore it and keeps walking home, growing more anxious. She then hears another “hey” and turns around, and sees that a stranger is holding the jersey. The stranger asks if the jersey is hers.
