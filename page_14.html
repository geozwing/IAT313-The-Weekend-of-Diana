        With the flashback clouding her thoughts, Lisa decides to go for a walk. It is now late in the evening, and she can’t shake the memories of her starting to remember the night. Her intuition is telling her that she needs to know who the other man is in her flashback, and is annoyed that she can’t remember. She supposes she could ask Lisa but isn’t too keen on doing that, but she knows that staying at home will just bother her. While on her walk, she remembers the jersey.
